_What happens when you cook chorizo with fragrant herbs, garlic and onion, then use this concoction as the base for risotto?
We could tell you, but the best way to find out is to try it yourself!
While you're at it, throw in some roasted cherry tomatoes for a sweet burst of flavour that also works to cut through the lovely richness of the dish._
